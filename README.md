üîó [Project Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGCGxwJQpo/AE-u1nBwy_46SF7qF8ZLJQ/view?utm_content=DAGCGxwJQpo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hdfef3dbaf6))

### üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on implementing **real-time object detection** to ensure the safety of construction workers by identifying personal protective equipment (PPE) in live video streams. The solution leverages **YOLOv9 (You Only Look Once)** ‚Äì a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that detects objects within images and video feeds efficiently.
